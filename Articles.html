    <h1>Cycling for positive mental health</h1>
    <p style="line-height:2.5;">
        -> It improves your mood. Regular cyclists often talk about the “cycling high”, cousin to the well-recognised “runner’s high”. Cycling pumps blood around your body at a greater rate which allows for the rapid spread of endorphins and other good substances like dopamine, norepinephrine and  <br>
        -> It promotes positive mental health. Self-Esteem, depression, anxiety and stress are all positively affected through exercise, but the nature of cycling has been shown to be one of the most effective activities for the head and heart.
        It helps you sleep better. <br> -> Regular riding helps synchronise your circadian rhythm and can help to reduce levels of stress hormones that can make proper regenerative, deep sleep difficult. <br>
       -> Improves your memory. Riding a bike helps to build new brain cells that are responsible for memory. See the ‘your brain on biking’ section later in this piece for more
        Improves creative thinking. <br> -> The regular, uniform  movement of cycling has a relaxing effect on the brain, stabilizing both physical and mental function. <br>
        -> Cycling promotes new thought patterns that promote feelings of calm and wellbeing. It can be a great way to “zone out,” but you can even use it for a form of meditation. <br>  Tip: Concentrate on the actions, each movement of your legs, the rhythm of your breathing, the wind on your face. <br> -> Focus only on the physical sensations and actions of riding and you may be surprised just how easily your mind clears.
       <br> -> It may benefit your (ahem) bedroom activities. Cycling exercises the same key muscles we use when making love.
        </p>
    <h1>Your Brain on biking</h1>
    <p style="line-height:2;"> -> Cycling can grow your brain in the same way it can grow your muscles. Blood flow to the brain increases just as it does with the muscles, bringing in more oxygen and nutrients that can improve its performance.
        <br>
       -> Riding increases the production of proteins used for creating new brain cells by two or three times the norm! It also increases the activities that allow the different regions of our brain to communicate more effectively.
        <br>
        -> Cycling has also been shown to counteract the natural decline of brain function and development as we age.</p>
        <h1>Social benefits</h1>
        <p style="line-height:2.3;">Cycling lends itself quite easily to joining a group of like-minded people, as former Australian Rugby professional Mat Rogers recently advised – “I think that blokes in a cycling bunch would be the least depressed of any group of men because they get stuff off their chest, they talk, and they don’t feel like they’re getting looked down on or judged.”
